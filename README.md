# Ulysses.UI.Web
The official web implementation of UI for Ulysses. 

## Specs

- **Front-end only implementation**: the implementation only interacts with the backend, including but not limited to Ulysses server, MySQL database server, via RESTful API provided by Ulysses. 
- **Minimalism**: the implementation should keep the overall resource usage when running on a server to a minimal viable level.
- **High programmability**: the implementation should provide clear interface for the ease of adding new functionalities. 
- **Localized**: the implementation should do the work locally on client's device, in case cannot prove the necessity of doing the work remotely on server.
